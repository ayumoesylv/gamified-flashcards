HI!

The following is a rough plan I have for this program, which will gamify my flashcard experience.

Functionality specifications:
- Allow user to input their flashcards and store this information permanently 
- Allow user to edit, add, delete their flashcards
- Allow user to go through their flashcards at random and see the back or front of the card 
- Allow user to rate their own memory of a card after viewing the card 
- Allow user to fight enemies to gain loot 
- Allow user to choose skill to use 
- Allow user to choose when to quit the application
